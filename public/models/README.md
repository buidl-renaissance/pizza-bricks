# 3D models for collectible pizzas

Add your GLB (and optionally USDZ for iOS AR) here:

- `pizza.glb` — used by collectibles that reference `/models/pizza.glb` in `src/content/collectibles.ts`.

For testing without a local file, use the **demo** collectible: `/pizza/demo` (uses a sample model from the web).
